### Open Source and Free Software

The Convox team is passionate about open source and offers
[Convox Rack](http://github.com/convox/rack) as free software under the
Apache 2.0 license.

This core Convox software will always be free to read, modify, install and run.

### Enterprise Services

The Convox team knows how to run production software reliably at scale.

Convox offers a fully managed rack service where Convox is responsible for the
installation, updates, monitoring and failure recovery of your infrastructure.
Convox also offers uptime and support SLAs.

Contact [support@convox.com](mailto:support@convox.com) for more information and
quotes.

### \*Resource Costs

The prices above are for Grid services only. Installing a Rack creates
infrastructure in your AWS account which incurs additional costs.

Convox chooses an infrastructure configuration that maximizes
reliability. For example, the default Convox cluster is 3 t2.smalls running in 3
availability zones. The convox API is running behind a dedicated ELB. These
choices give you the best reliability for running a apps and  set the
baseline cost at $80 / month.

We believe that this cost is reasonable for most engineering teams. We also
trust that AWS offers the best prices in the industry, and will continue their
track record of improving the price and performance of their services over time.

We understand that minimal resource cost is important startups and open source
projects. If you would like to use Convox but find the resource costs
prohibitive, contact [support@convox.com](mailto:support@convox.com) to discuss
a free trial and other options. Or contribute ideas and pull requests to 
[convox/rack](http://github.com/convox/rack) that help reduce the baseline
resource cost for everyone.
