Resources are like services, but are external to your application and which your application communicates with over a network.
Examples of typical resources used with Convox are data stores like RDS or redis, mailservers, and so on.

Resources are typically stateful services.

Resources correspond closely to Heroku's notion of [_backing services_](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/development-configuration#backing-services).
