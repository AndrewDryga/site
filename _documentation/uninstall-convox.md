title: "Uninstalling Convox"
---
Your rack can be uninstalled using the CLI. AWS credentials are required for this process, so please refer to the guide if you need to generate those. To uninstall type:

    $ convox uninstall

You may specify the region your cluster is installed in with the option --region (defaults to us-east-1):

    $ convox uninstall --region your-cluster-region

This will remove all of the AWS data and services created by Convox.
