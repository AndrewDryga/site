Convox makes it possible to subscribe to notifications about Rack lifecycle events via HTTP.

Provide a URL and we will HTTP POST a body of `application/json` on all events.
It is up to the receiver to act on and filter requests.

### Creating a Webhook service integration

Once you've set up an endpoint you can subscribe to notifications via:

    $ convox services create webhook --name Notifier --url http://example.org
    Creating Notifier (webhook)... CREATING

This kicks off the provisioning of a web hook. Creation time is under 30 seconds.

### Consuming a Webhook service integration

All events are sent as `HTTP POST` requests with a content type of `application/json`.

All payloads have the following structure:

```json
{
  "action":"object:action",
  "status":"success|error",
  "timestamp":"RFC 3339",
  "data":{},
}
```

The `action` will always be of the form: `object:action` and `status` will be one of `success` or `error`.
Every `data` section includes a `rack` set to the name of the rack this event came from (set at install time).
The timestamp is in [RFC 3339](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format.

For example, a promote on the app "foo" would be:

```json
{
  "action":"app:promote",
  "status":"success",
  "timestamp":"2015-10-28T03:46:24.106682533Z",
  "data":{
    "id":"RELEASE_ID",
    "name":"APP_NAME",
    "rack":"RACK_NAME"
  }
}
```

When the `status` is `error`, the `data` attribute will always have a `message` set to a string.

```json
{
  "action":"app:promote",
  "status":"error",
  "timestamp":"2015-10-28T03:46:24.106682533Z",
  "data":{
    "id":"RELEASE_ID",
    "name":"APP_NAME",
    "message":"something bad happened",
    "rack":"RACK_NAME"
  }
}
```

### Events and payloads

All values are strings.
All data includes the rack name as `rack`.
