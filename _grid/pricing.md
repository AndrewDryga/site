## Open Source and Free Software

The Convox team is passionate about open source and offers
[Convox Rack](http://github.com/convox/rack) as free software under the
Apache 2.0 license.

This core Convox software will always be free to read, modify, install and run.

## Free Plan

For free you can to install one or more racks, link apps to public GitHub repos,
configure a Slack integration for notifications, and give access to teammates.

Community support is available through the
[Convox Public Slack channel](http://invite.convox.com) and through the
[Convox GitHub projects](http://github.com/convox/rack)

## Basic Plan

Upgrading to the Basic Plan allows you to link apps to private GitHub repos. You
can still give access to teammates for free.

Priority support is available over email to
[support@convox.com](mailto:support@convox.com).

## Enterprise Services

The Convox team knows how to run production software reliably at scale.

Convox offers a fully managed rack service where Convox is responsible for the
installation, updates, monitoring and failure recovery of your infrastructure.
Convox also offers uptime and support SLAs.

Contact [support@convox.com](mailto:support@convox.com) for more information and
quotes.

Resource Costs

Installing Rack creates infrastructure in your AWS account which incurs costs.
On top of this, Convox chooses infrastructure configuration that maximizes
reliability, often at a higher price point.

For example, the default Convox cluster is 3 t2.smalls running in 3 availability
zones. The convox API is running behind a dedicated ELB. These choices give you
the best reliability for running a few apps, but sets the baseline cost at $80
/ month.

We believe that this cost is reasonable for most engineering teams. We also
trust that AWS offers the best prices in the industry, and will continue their
track record of improving the price and performance of their services over time.

We understand that minimal resource cost is important startups and open source
projects. If you would like to use Convox but find the resource costs
prohibitive, contact [support@convox.com](mailto:support@convox.com) to discuss
a free trial and other options. Or contribute ideas and pull requests to 
[convox/rack](http://github.com/convox/rack) that help reduce the baseline
resource cost for everyone.
