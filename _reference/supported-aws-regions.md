title: "Supported AWS Regions"
---

Convox will run in any region that supports EC2 Container Service, Lambda and at least three Availability Zones.

## Currently supported regions:

- us-east-1
- us-west-2
- eu-west-1
- ap-southeast-2


## Future Inclusion
Regions such as `eu-west-1 (Ireland)` and `us-west-1 (N. California)` are not supported for their limited Availability Zones support. This can change in the future for any region, so as soon as a region supports the required services to run a Convox Rack, this list will be updated accordingly.
