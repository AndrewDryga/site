Getting started with Rails on Convox is easy. Your app will need a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

See [Preparing an Application](/docs/preparing-an-application) for more details.

## What's Included

The Convox-generated `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` will give you a good starting configuration that leverages Heroku's open-source [ruby buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby) to build your application.

## Running the Application

See [Running Locally](/docs/running-locally) and [Deploying to Convox](/docs/deploying-to-convox).
